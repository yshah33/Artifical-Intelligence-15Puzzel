15-Puzzle Solver Using Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)

Overview
This project implements an Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm to solve the 15-puzzle game. The 15-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles from 1 to 15 and one empty space represented by 0. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to achieve a sequential order from 1 to 15 with the empty space at the end.

Features
Input: 
  Initial board configuration in the form of a sequence of numbers (0 indicates the empty space).

Output:
  Moves: Sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.
  Number of Nodes Expanded: Total number of nodes expanded during the search.
  Time Taken: Time taken to find the solution.
  Memory Used: Memory used during the execution.

Example
Input: 1 0 2 4 5 7 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15
Output:
  Moves: RDLDDRR
  Number of Nodes Expanded: 361
