# 15 Puzzle AI - Optimized Search Algorithms

This repository contains various AI algorithms used to solve the 15 Puzzle problem. Performance improvements are implemented to optimize search efficiency, with a focus on reducing computational complexity and enhancing solution speed.

## Algorithms & Optimization
- **A* Search**: Optimized with heuristics (Manhattan Distance, Misplaced Tiles).
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Uses a queue for optimal pathfinding.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Implemented with depth limit checks.
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: Model-based approach for decision-making.

### Performance & Complexity Analysis
- **A***: Best performance for large puzzles, with time complexity of O(b^d), where b is branching factor and d is depth. Optimized with heuristics for faster solutions.
- **BFS**: Guarantees optimal solution but performs poorly for large states due to memory usage.
- **DFS**: Not optimal but memory-efficient. Suitable for small state spaces or deep searches.
- **MDP**: Optimal for decision-making but requires significant computation time for state transitions.
